I don't understandI can't ever find itNot the right answer, not what normal isThe world is so very, very far awayIt's in a place where I can't reach it And the spring that embraced the pools of sunlight...Feels like it will disappear because the summer shines too brightlyIf I'm just going to end up withered and dry on the asphalt,Then I wish I'd stayed hidden under the rocks I destroyed it all againI didn't want to lose it, I didn't want to forget itBut I wasn't strong enough and I ended up letting go...Even though I knew that it was importantOh, everything's ended up a mess,But if everything hasn't disappeared yet... then I want to go backI want to tell themIf it's allowed, then I don't want to give up! I didn't want anyone to find meBut being with you made me so very happyAnd I haven't told you that, so...So, please...I didn't want to hurt anyoneI didn't want to leave you this wayWhat should I do?The words I couldn't say... are still words I want to reach you! The song I sing; I'll sing it nowPlease reach all the way to your heartIs there still time?I'll scream my heart, so that I can get past the wordsBecause this is the only way I can do itI'll keep singing until it reaches you I want to cry togetherI want to laugh togetherEven if our paths only run parallelStill holding tightly to yesterdayTrembling with a throbbing painThe more it hurts, the more your emotions came through, so I won't leave you I'll sing this song that will link my hands with yoursI don't want to let go, let's stay together foreverI'll sing this song that will help us become ourselvesI'll sing and let's begin here one more time
